    <p>Spidermans latest movie <em>NO WAY HOME</em> in my opinion really shattered me into bits. After
    seeing what this Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has gone through over these passed years this movie was
    a rewatch. I enjoy this Spiderman a lot more only because how many times he's been torn turns out he
    did want revenge but other universes helped him out to go down that path.

    <p>
        Doctor Strange when I first heard of him was really fully of himself; well this time around 
        in this movie he showed the changes people can make and the choices you make in life.

        <p>
            I enjoy Iron Man for this stubborness and how cocky he can be. Through-out the Marvel movies
            with the Avengers he's proven different personas of himself depending on his surroundings. In
            the latest movie he's proven to have a heart not just for his loved ones but the universe.
